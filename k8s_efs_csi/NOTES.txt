For this to work you have to:

- Create EFS and copy it's ID - "fs-xxxxxxx..."
- The EFS has to be reachable from pods - that means a special SG for EFS that allows trafic on 2049
- The NodeGroup defauly IAM role needs this new policy attached:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowNodeDoItsThing",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
                "elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite",
                "elasticfilesystem:ClientMount",
                "elasticfilesystem:DescribeMountTargets"
            ]
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
